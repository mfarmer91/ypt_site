          Man, when homemade pasta -- that doesn't suck -- hits your lips for the first time, you can't just stop at one serving.  I am saddened that I did not think to develop pasta making skills sooner, as freshly-made egg noodles enhance one's quality of life.  This second, successful attempt at making pasta functions as my second exam in pasta-making 101.  I made at A minus.  Hey, at this point, I'll take it.  The pasta was actually edible, and I think other fools will respect my technique.

          Ye, so, the first time I made pasta, my main mistake was forgetting to re-flour my dough after it was rolled out.  That was a foolish blunder.  In fact, the lack of white, non-cocaine, cooking dust was so great, that the end result of my initial pasta-making journey was pure failure.  For comparison, mind map the final scene in Lord of the Rings: Return of the King.  My technique's embodiment was Smeagle; foolishly following the ring, my pasta, into the boiling water, and heating into nothingness.  The painstakingly rolled and folded raw dough was compressed into disks as I cut the noodles -- still hopeful.
